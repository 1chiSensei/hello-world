                                C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a general-purpose
                                programming language created by Bjarne
                                Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming
                                language, or "C with Classes". The language has
                                expanded significantly over time, and modern C++
                                now has object-oriented, generic, and functional
                                features in addition to facilities for low-level
                                memory manipulation. It is almost always
                                implemented as a compiled language, and many
                                vendors provide C++ compilers, including the
                                Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft,
                                Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on
                                many platforms.

                                C++ was designed with a bias toward system
                                programming and embedded, resource-constrained
                                software and large systems, with performance,
                                efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design
                                highlights. C++ has also been found useful in
                                many other contexts, with key strengths being
                                software infrastructure and resource-constrained
                                applications, including desktop applications,
                                video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web
                                search, or SQL servers), and
                                performance-critical applications (e.g.
                                telephone switches or space probes).

                                C++ is standardized by the International
                                Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the
                                latest standard version ratified and published
                                by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020
                                (informally known as C++20). The C++ programming
                                language was initially standardized in 1998 as
                                ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by
                                the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards.
                                The current C++20 standard supersedes these with
                                new features and an enlarged standard library.
                                Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++
                                was developed by Danish computer scientist
                                Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an
                                extension of the C language; he wanted an
                                efficient and flexible language similar to C
                                that also provided high-level features for
                                program organization. Since 2012, C++ is on a
                                three-year release schedule, with C++23 the next
                                planned standard.
