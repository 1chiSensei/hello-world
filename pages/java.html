                        <hr />
                        <p>
                                Java is a class-based, object-oriented
                                programming language that is designed to have as
                                few implementation dependencies as possible. It
                                is a general-purpose programming language
                                intended to let application developers write
                                once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled
                                Java code can run on all platforms that support
                                Java without the need for recompilation. Java
                                applications are typically compiled to bytecode
                                that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
                                regardless of the underlying computer
                                architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C
                                and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than
                                either of them. The Java runtime provides
                                dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and
                                runtime code modification) that are typically
                                not available in traditional compiled languages.
                                As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular
                                programming languages in use according to
                                GitHub, particularly for client-server web
                                applications, with a reported 9 million
                                developers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Java was originally developed by James Gosling
                                at Sun Microsystems (which has since been
                                acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a
                                core component of Sun Microsystems' Java
                                platform. The original and reference
                                implementation Java compilers, virtual machines,
                                and class libraries were originally released by
                                Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007,
                                in compliance with the specifications of the
                                Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most
                                of its Java technologies under the GNU General
                                Public License. Oracle offers its own HotSpot
                                Java Virtual Machine, however the official
                                reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM
                                which is free open source software and used by
                                most developers and is the default JVM for
                                almost all Linux distributions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                As of September 2020, the latest version is Java
                                15, with Java 11, a currently supported
                                long-term support (LTS) version, released on
                                September 25, 2018. Oracle released the last
                                zero-cost public update for the legacy version
                                Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial use,
                                although it will otherwise still support Java 8
                                with public updates for personal use
                                indefinitely. Other vendors have begun to offer
                                zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11 that are
                                still receiving security and other upgrades.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Oracle (and others) highly recommend
                                uninstalling outdated versions of Java because
                                of serious risks due to unresolved security
                                issues. Since Java 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 are no
                                longer supported, Oracle advises its users to
                                immediately transition to the latest version
                                (currently Java 15) or an LTS release.
