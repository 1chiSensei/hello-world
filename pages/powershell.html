                        <p>
                                PowerShell is a task automation and
                                configuration management framework from
                                Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell
                                and the associated scripting language. Initially
                                a Windows component only, known as Windows
                                PowerShell, it was made open-source and
                                cross-platform on 18 August 2016 with the
                                introduction of PowerShell Core. The former is
                                built on the .NET Framework, the latter on .NET
                                Core.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                In PowerShell, administrative tasks are
                                generally performed by cmdlets (pronounced
                                command-lets), which are specialized .NET
                                classes implementing a particular operation.
                                These work by accessing data in different data
                                stores, like the file system or registry, which
                                are made available to PowerShell via providers.
                                Third-party developers can add cmdlets and
                                providers to PowerShell. Cmdlets may be used by
                                scripts and scripts may be packaged into
                                modules.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                PowerShell provides full access to COM and WMI,
                                enabling administrators to perform
                                administrative tasks on both local and remote
                                Windows systems as well as WS-Management and CIM
                                enabling management of remote Linux systems and
                                network devices. PowerShell also provides a
                                hosting API with which the PowerShell runtime
                                can be embedded inside other applications. These
                                applications can then use PowerShell
                                functionality to implement certain operations,
                                including those exposed via the graphical
                                interface. This capability has been used by
                                Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 to expose its
                                management functionality as PowerShell cmdlets
                                and providers and implement the graphical
                                management tools as PowerShell hosts which
                                invoke the necessary cmdlets. Other Microsoft
                                applications including Microsoft SQL Server 2008
                                also expose their management interface via
                                PowerShell cmdlets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                PowerShell includes its own extensive,
                                console-based help (similar to man pages in Unix
                                shells) accessible via the Get-Help cmdlet.
                                Updated local help contents can be retrieved
                                from the Internet via the Update-Help cmdlet.
                                Alternatively, help from the web can be acquired
                                on a case-by-case basis via the -online switch
                                to Get-Help.
