                        <p>
                                COBOL (/ˈkoʊbɒl, -bɔːl/; an acronym for "common
                                business-oriented language") is a compiled
                                English-like computer programming language
                                designed for business use. It is imperative,
                                procedural and, since 2002, object-oriented.
                                COBOL is primarily used in business, finance,
                                and administrative systems for companies and
                                governments. COBOL is still widely used in
                                applications deployed on mainframe computers,
                                such as large-scale batch and transaction
                                processing jobs. However, due to its declining
                                popularity and the retirement of experienced
                                COBOL programmers, programs are being migrated
                                to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages
                                or replaced with software packages. Most
                                programming in COBOL is now purely to maintain
                                existing applications; however, many large
                                financial institutions were still developing new
                                systems in COBOL in 2006 due to the mainframe
                                processing speed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was
                                partly based on the programming language
                                FLOW-MATIC designed by Grace Hopper. It was
                                created as part of a US Department of Defense
                                effort to create a portable programming language
                                for data processing. It was originally seen as a
                                stopgap, but the Department of Defense promptly
                                forced computer manufacturers to provide it,
                                resulting in its widespread adoption. It was
                                standardized in 1968 and has since been revised
                                four times. Expansions include support for
                                structured and object-oriented programming. The
                                current standard is ISO/IEC 1989:2014.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                COBOL statements have an English-like syntax,
                                which was designed to be self-documenting and
                                highly readable. However, it is verbose and uses
                                over 300 reserved words. In contrast with
                                modern, succinct syntax like y = x;, COBOL has a
                                more English-like syntax (in this case, MOVE x
                                TO y). COBOL code is split into four divisions
                                (identification, environment, data, and
                                procedure) containing a rigid hierarchy of
                                sections, paragraphs and sentences. Lacking a
                                large standard library, the standard specifies
                                43 statements, 87 functions and just one class.

                                Academic computer scientists were generally
                                uninterested in business applications when COBOL
                                was created and were not involved in its design;
                                it was (effectively) designed from the ground up
                                as a computer language for business, with an
                                emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data
                                types were numbers and strings of text. COBOL
                                has been criticized throughout its life for its
                                verbosity, design process, and poor support for
                                structured programming. These weaknesses result
                                in monolithic and, though intended to be
                                English-like, not easily comprehensible and
                                verbose programs.
