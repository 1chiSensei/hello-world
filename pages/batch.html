                        <p>
                                A batch file is a script file in DOS, OS/2 and
                                Microsoft Windows. It consists of a series of
                                commands to be executed by the command-line
                                interpreter, stored in a plain text file. A
                                batch file may contain any command the
                                interpreter accepts interactively and use
                                constructs that enable conditional branching and
                                looping within the batch file, such as IF, FOR,
                                and GOTO labels. The term "batch" is from batch
                                processing, meaning "non-interactive execution",
                                though a batch file may not process a batch of
                                multiple data.

                                Similar to Job Control Language (JCL), DCL and
                                other systems on mainframe and minicomputer
                                systems, batch files were added to ease the work
                                required for certain regular tasks by allowing
                                the user to set up a script to automate them.
                                When a batch file is run, the shell program
                                (usually COMMAND.COM or cmd.exe) reads the file
                                and executes its commands, normally
                                line-by-line. Unix-like operating systems, such
                                as Linux, have a similar, but more flexible,
                                type of file called a shell script.

                                The filename extension .bat is used in DOS and
                                Windows. Windows NT and OS/2 also added .cmd.
                                Batch files for other environments may have
                                different extensions, e.g., .btm in 4DOS, 4OS2
                                and 4NT related shells.

                                The detailed handling of batch files has changed
                                significantly between versions. Some of the
                                detail in this article applies to all batch
                                files, while other details apply only to certain
                                versions.
