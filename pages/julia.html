                        <p>
                                Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic
                                programming language. While it is a
                                general-purpose language and can be used to
                                write any application, many of its features are
                                well suited for numerical analysis and
                                computational science.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Distinctive aspects of Julia's design include a
                                type system with parametric polymorphism in a
                                dynamic programming language; with multiple
                                dispatch as its core programming paradigm. Julia
                                supports concurrent, (composable) parallel and
                                distributed computing (with or without using MPI
                                and/or the built-in corresponding to
                                "OpenMP-style" threads), and direct calling of C
                                and Fortran libraries without glue code. Julia
                                uses a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that is
                                referred to as "just-ahead-of-time" (JAOT) in
                                the Julia community, as Julia compiles (on
                                default settings) to machine code before running
                                it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Julia is garbage-collected, uses eager
                                evaluation, and includes efficient libraries for
                                floating-point calculations, linear algebra,
                                random number generation, and regular expression
                                matching. Many libraries are available,
                                including some (e.g., for fast Fourier
                                transforms) that were previously bundled with
                                Julia and are now separate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Several development tools support coding in
                                Julia, such as integrated development
                                environments (e.g. Microsoft's Visual Studio
                                Code, with extensions available adding Julia
                                support to IDEs, e.g. providing debugging and
                                linting support); with integrated tools, e.g. a
                                profiler (and flame graph support available for
                                the built-in one), debugger, and the Rebugger.jl
                                package "supports repeated-execution debugging"
                                and more.
