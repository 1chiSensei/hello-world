                                C (/siÀê/, as in the letter c) is a
                                general-purpose, procedural computer programming
                                language supporting structured programming,
                                lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a
                                static type system. By design, C provides
                                constructs that map efficiently to typical
                                machine instructions. It has found lasting use
                                in applications previously coded in assembly
                                language. Such applications include operating
                                systems and various application software for
                                computer architectures that range from
                                supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.

                                A successor to the programming language B, C was
                                originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis
                                Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct
                                utilities running on Unix. It was applied to
                                re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating
                                system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained
                                popularity. It has become one of the most widely
                                used programming languages, with C compilers
                                from various vendors available for the majority
                                of existing computer architectures and operating
                                systems. C has been standardized by the ANSI
                                since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International
                                Organization for Standardization (ISO). As of
                                September 2020, C is the most popular
                                programming language.

                                C is an imperative procedural language. It was
                                designed to be compiled to provide low-level
                                access to memory and language constructs that
                                map efficiently to machine instructions, all
                                with minimal runtime support. Despite its
                                low-level capabilities, the language was
                                designed to encourage cross-platform
                                programming. A standards-compliant C program
                                written with portability in mind can be compiled
                                for a wide variety of computer platforms and
                                operating systems with few changes to its source
                                code.
