                        <p>
                                A shell script is a computer program designed to
                                be run by the Unix shell, a command-line
                                interpreter. The various dialects of shell
                                scripts are considered to be scripting
                                languages. Typical operations performed by shell
                                scripts include file manipulation, program
                                execution, and printing text. A script which
                                sets up the environment, runs the program, and
                                does any necessary cleanup, logging, etc. is
                                called a wrapper.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The term is also used more generally to mean the
                                automated mode of running an operating system
                                shell; in specific operating systems they are
                                called other things such as batch files
                                (MSDos-Win95 stream, OS/2), command procedures
                                (VMS), and shell scripts (Windows NT stream and
                                third-party derivatives like 4NTâ€”article is at
                                cmd.exe), and mainframe operating systems are
                                associated with a number of terms.

                                The typical Unix/Linux/POSIX-compliant
                                installation includes the KornShell (ksh) in
                                several possible versions such as ksh88, Korn
                                Shell '93 and others. The oldest shell still in
                                common use is the Bourne shell (sh); Unix
                                systems invariably also include the C shell
                                (csh), Bash (bash), a Remote Shell (rsh), a
                                Secure Shell (ssh) for SSL telnet connections,
                                and a shell which is a main component of the
                                Tcl/Tk installation usually called tclsh; wish
                                is a GUI-based Tcl/Tk shell. The C and Tcl
                                shells have syntax quite similar to that of said
                                programming languages, and the Korn shells and
                                Bash are developments of the Bourne shell, which
                                is based on the ALGOL language with elements of
                                a number of others added as well. On the other
                                hand, the various shells plus tools like awk,
                                sed, grep, and BASIC, Lisp, C and so forth
                                contributed to the Perl programming language.

                                Other shells available on a machine or available
                                for download and/or purchase include Almquist
                                shell (ash), PowerShell (msh), Z shell (zsh, a
                                particularly common enhanced KornShell), the
                                Tenex C Shell (tcsh), a Perl-like shell (psh).
                                Related programs such as shells based on Python,
                                Ruby, C, Java, Perl, Pascal, Rexx &c in various
                                forms are also widely available. Another
                                somewhat common shell is osh, whose manual page
                                states it "is an enhanced, backward-compatible
                                port of the standard command interpreter from
                                Sixth Edition UNIX."
